    <div style="background-color:orange; color: black; font-weight: bold;">
        <h1>Using DIV</h1>
        <p>The DIV element is commonly used to create layouts in HTML. By grouping content inside
           <div style="color: brown; float: right;" > DIV tags, web developers can organize a webpage into different sections, such as</div> header, sidebar, main content, and footer. 
            This makes it easier to style each part using CSS</p>
